Gem for exporting user-scripts as Upstart scripts
====================

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/funbox/upstart-exporter.png)](http://travis-ci.org/funbox/upstart-exporter)

Purpose
-------

It is often neccessary to run some supporting background tasks for rails projects alongside with the webserver. One of the solutions is use of Foreman gem, which allows to export tasks as Upstart scripts. This solution is dangerous, because it requires root priveleges for foreman executable (in order to add scripts to /etc/init), so it allows the exporting user to run any code as root (by placing appropriate script into /etc/init).

This gem is an attempt to provide a safe way for installing backround jobs, so that they run under some fixed user without root priveleges.

The only interface to the gem that should be used is the script(*upstart-export*) it provides.

Installing
----------

    gem install upstart-exporter


Configuration
-------------

The export process is configured through the only config, /etc/upstart-exporter.yaml, which is a simple YAML file of the following format:

    ---
    run_user: www # The user under which all installed through upstart-exporter background jobs are run
    run_group: www # The group of run_user
    helper_dir: /var/helper_dir # Auxilary directory for scripts incapsulating background jobs
    upstart_dir: /var/upstart_dir # Directory where upstart scripts should be placed
    prefix: 'myupstartjobs-' # Prefix added to app's log folders and upstart scripts
    respawn: # Controls how often job can fail and be restarted, set to false to prohibit restart after failure
      limit: 10 # Number of allowed restarts in given interval
      interval: 10 # Interval in seconds

The config is not installed by default. If this config is absent, the default values are the following:

    helper_dir: /var/local/upstart_helpers/
    upstart_dir: /etc/init/
    run_user: service
    prefix: 'fb-'
    respawn:
      limit: 5
      interval: 10

To give a certain user (i.e. deployuser) ability to use this script, you can place the following lines into sudoers file:

    # Commands required for manipulating jobs
    Cmnd_Alias UPSTART = /sbin/start, /sbin/stop, /sbin/restart
    Cmnd_Alias UPEXPORT = /usr/local/bin/upstart-export

    ...

    # Add gem's binary path to this
    Defaults    secure_path = /sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin

    ...

    # Allow deploy user to manipulate jobs
    deployuser        ALL=(deployuser) NOPASSWD: ALL, (root) NOPASSWD: UPSTART, UPEXPORT


Usage
-----

Gem is able to process two versions of Procfile's, format of the Procfile is
defined in the _version_ key. If the key is not present or is not equal to _2_
gem will try to parse it as Procfile v.1.

Procfile v.1
------------

After upstart-exporter is installed and configured, you may export background jobs from an arbitrary Procfile-like file of the following format:

    cmdlabel1: cmd1
    cmdlabel2: cmd2

i.e. a file ./myprocfile containing:

    my_tail_cmd: /usr/bin/tail -F /var/log/messages
    my_another_tail_cmd: /usr/bin/tail -F /var/log/messages

For security purposes, command labels are allowed to contain only letters, digits, and underscores.

Procfile v.2
------------

Another format of Procfile scripts is YAML config. A configuration script may
look like this:

    version: 2
    start_on_runlevel: "[2345]"
    stop_on_runlevel: "[06]"
    env:
      RAILS_ENV: production
      TEST: true
    working_directory: /srv/projects/mpro/current
    commands:
      my_tail_cmd:
        command: /usr/bin/tail -F /var/log/messages
        respawn:
          count: 5
          interval: 10
        env:
          RAILS_ENV: staging # if needs to be redefined or extended
        working_directory: '/var/...' # if needs to be redefined
      my_another_tail_cmd:
        command: /usr/bin/tail -F /var/log/messages
        respawn: false # by default respawn option is enabled
      my_one_another_tail_cmd:
        command: /usr/bin/tail -F /var/log/messages
      my_multi_tail_cmd:
        command: /usr/bin/tail -F /var/log/messages
        count: 2

*start_on_runlevel* and *stop_on_runlevel* are two global options that can't be
redefined. For more information on these options look into [upstart scripts documentation.]( http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#start-on)

*working_directory* will generate the next line:

    cd 'your/working/directory' && your_command

*env* params can be redefined and extended in per-command options. Note, that
you can't remove globally defined *env* variable.
For given earlier Procfile example the generated command will look like:

    env RAILS_ENV=staging TEST=true your_command

*respawn* option controls restarting of scripts in case of their failure.
By default this option is enabled. For
more info look into [documentation](http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#respawn)).

*respawn_limit* option controls how often job can fail. If the job restarts more
often than *count* times in *interval*, it won't be restarted anymore. For more
info look into [documentation](http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#respawn-limit).

Options *working_directory*, *env*, *respawn* and *respawn_limit* can be
defined both as global and as per-command options.

Exporting
---------

To export Procfile you should run

    sudo upstart-export -p ./myprocfile -n myapp

where _myapp_ is the application name. This name only affects the names of generated files. For security purposes, app name is also allowed to contain only letters, digits and underscores. Assuming that default options are used, the following files and folders will be generated:

in /etc/init/:

    fb-myapp-my_another_tail_cmd.conf
    fb-myapp-my_tail_cmd.conf
    fb-myapp.conf

in /var/local/upstart\_helpers/:

    fb-myapp-my_another_tail_cmd.sh
    fb-myapp-my_tail_cmd.sh

Prefix 'fb-' (which can be customised through config) is added to avoid collisions with other upstart jobs. After this my\_tail\_cmd, for example, will be able to be started as an upstart script:

    sudo start fb-myapp-my_tail_cmd

    ..

    sudo stop fb-myapp-my_tail_cmd

It's stdout/stderr will be redirected to /var/log/fb-myapp/my\_tail\_cmd.log.

To start/stop all application commands at once, you can run:

    sudo start fb-myapp
    ...
    sudo stop fb-myapp

To remove upstart scripts and helpers for a particular application you can run

    sudo upstart-export -c -n myapp

The logs are not cleared in this case. Also, all old application scripts are cleared before each export.
